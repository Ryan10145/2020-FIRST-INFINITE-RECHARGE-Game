# First Infinite Recharge

## Description

This game is a 2D version of the 2020 First Robotics Competition (FRC) game "Infinite Recharge". In the actual game, two teams of three robots each play against each other to score as many points as possible during the match. In this 2D simplified version, each team only has one robot, which can be controlled by each player. The original game also includes various other tasks used for scoring, such as climbing and spinning the control panel, but those were omitted due to a lack of time and difficulty implementing in a 2D environment. To see a quick rundown of the original FRC game, click [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmiYWTmFRVE) for the game animation. A picture of this 2D game is included below.
